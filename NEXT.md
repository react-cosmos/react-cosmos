# React Cosmos

A tool for ambitious UI developers.

- **Laser focus.** No need to load the entire app for every change you make. From UI primitives to entire app sections, isolate the part you're working on and iterate quickly.
- **Component library.** From blank states to normal states to edge cases, define component states to come back to. Your component library helps you stay organized and makes a great foundation of _test cases_.
- **Long term design.** Keeping your components decoupled leads to reusable code, a robust architecture, and saves you from having to rewrite your UI every two years.

The [example package](example) is a useful complement to this guide.

## Config

No config is required to start. If you have custom needs or would like to convert a Cosmos Classic config, here's what you need to know.

The Cosmos Next config is a **JSON** file, so it can only host serializable values. This design decision is meant to discourage complex configuration, make it easy to embed config options into the UI, and enable visual config management in the future.

By default, Cosmos reads `cosmos.config.json` from your root directory. You can pass a `--config` CLI arg for a custom config path.

> Most Cosmos Classic config options are still supported in the new JSON format. [Let me know](https://join-react-cosmos.now.sh/) if you need old config options that no longer work.

### Available options

The best way to learn about the available options in the Cosmos config is to use [config.schema.json](packages/react-cosmos/config.schema.json).

The schema is human readable, but you can also enhance your config with autocomplete in code editors like VS Code.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/cosmos-config"
  // your options...
}
```

And if you use VS Code you can map the Cosmos config schema globally by [extending your user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_mapping-in-the-user-settings).

```json
"json.schemas": [
  {
    "fileMatch": ["cosmos.config.json"],
    "url": "http://json.schemastore.org/cosmos-config"
  }
]
```

## Webpack

Configuring webpack is the least romantic aspect of the Cosmos setup. Luckily, you only do it once. Depending on your setup, one of the following options will work for you.

### Default webpack config

In many cases Cosmos manages to get webpack working without human intervention. Try running Cosmos as is first.

### Custom webpack config

Probably the most common scenario. Most of us end up with a hairy webpack config sooner or later. Use the `webpack.configPath` setting to point to an existing webpack config.

You can also point to a module inside a dependency, like in the following Create React App example.

```json
{
  "watchDirs": ["src"],
  "webpack": {
    "configPath": "react-scripts/config/webpack.config"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- It's important to set both `watchDirs` and `webpack.configPath` options to seamlessly integrate with Create React App.

### Webpack config override

Overriding the webpack config gives you complete control. Use the `webpack.overridePath` setting to point to a module that customizes the webpack config used by Cosmos.

```json
{
  "webpack": {
    "overridePath": "./webpack.override.js"
  }
}
```

The override function receives a base webpack config — the default one generated by Cosmos or a custom one loaded from `webpack.configPath`. Extend the input config and return the result.

```js
// webpack.override.js
module.exports = (webpackConfig, env) => {
  return { ...webpackConfig /* do your thing */ };
};
```

## JSX fixtures

Cosmos Next introduces a more natural format for component fixtures: **React elements** and **React functions.**

Some advantages compared to the old format in Cosmos Classic:

- Fixtures are no longer bound to a single component
- Adding one or more component wrappers per fixture is easy
- Fixtures can be copy pasted inside the project source code
- Props are easier to type-check
- Writing fixtures doesn't feel like writing code for Cosmos

The new fixtures formats also come with a minor drawback: `React` must be imported in every fixture file.

## Element fixtures

> Think of Element fixtures as the return value of a render function, or the first argument to `React.render`.

```jsx
// __fixtures__/disabled.js
export default <Button disabled>Click me</Button>;
```

## Function fixtures

Function fixtures are like a component with no props. They enable using Hooks inside fixtures, which is powerful for simulating state with stateless components.

```jsx
// CounterButton.fixture.js
export default () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return <CounterButton count={count} increment={() => setCount(count + 1)} />;
};
```

## Multi fixture files

A fixture file can also export multiple fixtures if the default export is an object.

```jsx
// buttons.fixture.js
export default {
  primary: <PrimaryButton>Click me</PrimaryButton>,
  primaryDisabled: <PrimaryButton disabled>Click me</PrimaryButton>,
  secondary: <SecondaryButton>Click me</SecondaryButton>,
  secondaryDisabled: <SecondaryButton disabled>Click me</SecondaryButton>
};
```

The object property names will show up as fixture names in the Cosmos UI.

> [See this comment](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/issues/924#issuecomment-462082405) for the reasoning behind this solution (vs named exports).

## How to create fixture files

Two options:

1. End fixture file names with `.fixture.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
2. Put fixture files inside `__fixtures__`

Examples:

1. `blankState.fixture.js`
2. `__fixtures__/blankState.js`

> File name conventions can be configured using the `fixturesDir` and `fixtureFileSuffix` options.

Notes:

- **IMPORTANT:** Fixture files must be placed in the `src` directory when using Create React App, in order for Cosmos to bundle in the exact same environment as Create React App's.

## Decorators

Wrapping components inside fixtures is now easy, but can become repetitive. _Decorators_ can be used to apply one or more component wrappers to a group of fixtures automatically.

A `cosmos.decorator` file looks like this:

```jsx
// cosmos.decorator.js
export default ({ children }) => <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
```

> A decorator file only applies to fixture files that are contained in the decorator file's directory. Multiple decorator files can be composed, in the order of their position in the file system hierarchy (from outer to inner).

## UI-controlled values

The _props panel_ allows you to manipulate component props visually by default. But you can also get a _custom values panel_ with minimal work.

```jsx
// CounterButton.fixture.js
import { useValue } from 'react-cosmos/fixture';

export default () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useValue(0);
  return <CounterButton count={count} increment={() => setCount(count + 1)} />;
};
```

> Heads up: `useValue` works great with TypeScript.

### Redux state mock

Check out [react-cosmos-redux](https://github.com/skidding/react-cosmos-redux) to see what a Cosmos Next decorator looks like. It works with the latest `react-redux` version and it's written in _Hooks_ 💃.

## UI plugins

A main feature of the Cosmos Next redesign is the brand-new UI plugin architecture. While the new UI is created 100% from plugins, the plugin API is not yet documented nor made accessible. It will take a few big steps to get there, but this is the future.

While we get feedback for the new JSX fixtures and decorators, I will continue to add feature parity with the old Cosmos UI and gradually release the powerful plugin API for mass consumption. Exciting things ahead!

### Custom responsive viewports

`responsivePreview` is a plugin included by default, and you can customize it through the Cosmos config.

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "responsivePreview": {
      "devices": [
        { "label": "iPhone 5", "width": 320, "height": 568 },
        { "label": "iPhone 6", "width": 375, "height": 667 },
        { "label": "iPhone 6 Plus", "width": 414, "height": 736 },
        { "label": "Medium", "width": 1024, "height": 768 },
        { "label": "Large", "width": 1440, "height": 900 },
        { "label": "1080p", "width": 1920, "height": 1080 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## React Native

```
npm run cosmos-native
```

Cosmos Next works great with React Native. Put the following inside `App.js` to get started.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { NativeFixtureLoader } from 'react-cosmos/native';
// You generate cosmos.userdeps.js when you start the Cosmos server
import { rendererConfig, fixtures, decorators } from './cosmos.userdeps';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NativeFixtureLoader
        rendererConfig={rendererConfig}
        fixtures={fixtures}
        decorators={decorators}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

Once your fixtures are loading properly, you'll probably want to split your App entry point to load Cosmos in development and your root component in production. Something like this:

```js
module.exports = global.__DEV__
  ? require('./App.cosmos')
  : require('./App.main');
```

> Using React Native for Web? Run `cosmos --external-userdeps` instead of `cosmos-native` and Cosmos will mirror your fixtures on both DOM and Native renderers.

Notes:

- React Native blacklists `__fixtures__` dirs by default. Unless you configure Cosmos to use a different directory pattern, you need to [override `getBlacklistRE` in the React Native CLI config](https://github.com/skidding/jobs-done/blob/585b1c472a123c9221dfec9018c9fa1e976d715e/rn-cli.config.js).

## Server-side APIs

> Do **NOT** use these APIs in your fixture files, or any of your client code, as they require access to the file system and may bundle unwanted Node code in your client build.

### Config

Fetching a Cosmos config can be done in a number of ways, depending on whether or not you have a config file and, in case you do, if you prefer to specify the path manually or to rely on automatic detection.

#### Detect existing config based on cwd

`detectCosmosConfig` uses the same config detection strategy as the `cosmos` command.

```js
import { detectCosmosConfig } from 'react-cosmos';

const cosmosConfig = detectCosmosConfig();
```

#### Read existing config at exact path

`getCosmosConfigAtPath` is best when you don't want to care where you run a script from.

```js
import { getCosmosConfigAtPath } from 'react-cosmos';

const cosmosConfig = getCosmosConfigAtPath(require.resolve('./cosmos.config'));
```

#### Create default config

The minimum requirement to create a config is a root directory.

```js
import { createCosmosConfig } from 'react-cosmos';

const cosmosConfig = createCosmosConfig(__dirname);
```

#### Create custom config

You can also customize your config programatically, without the need for an external config file.

```js
import { createCosmosConfig } from 'react-cosmos';

const cosmosConfig = createCosmosConfig(__dirname, {
  // Options... (TypeScript is your friend)
});
```

### Fixture URLs

A list with one Playground URL for each fixture, optionally in full-screen mode. A common use case for `getFixtureUrls` is to create visual snapshots for each fixture, and potentially to diff them between deploys.

```js
import { getFixtureUrls } from 'react-cosmos';

const fixtureUrls = await getFixtureUrls({ cosmosConfig, fullScreen: true });

console.log(fixtureUrls);
// localhost:5000/?fixtureId=%7B%22path%22%3A%22\_\_fixtures\_\_%2FHello%20World.ts%22%2C%22name%22%3Anull%7D&fullScreen=true
// localhost:5000/?fixtureId=%7B%22path%22%3A%22\_\_fixtures\_\_%2FProps%20Playground.tsx%22%2C%22name%22%3Anull%7D&fullScreen=true
// localhost:5000/?fixtureId=%7B%22path%22%3A%22\_\_fixtures\_\_%2FState%20Playground.tsx%22%2C%22name%22%3Anull%7D&fullScreen=true
// localhost:5000/?fixtureId=%7B%22path%22%3A%22Counter%2Findex.fixture.tsx%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22default%22%7D&fullScreen=true
// localhost:5000/?fixtureId=%7B%22path%22%3A%22Counter%2Findex.fixture.tsx%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22small%20number%22%7D&fullScreen=true
// localhost:5000/?fixtureId=%7B%22path%22%3A%22Counter%2Findex.fixture.tsx%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22large%20number%22%7D&fullScreen=true
// localhost:5000/?fixtureId=%7B%22path%22%3A%22CounterButton%2Findex.fixture.tsx%22%2C%22name%22%3Anull%7D&fullScreen=true
// localhost:5000/?fixtureId=%7B%22path%22%3A%22WelcomeMessage%2Findex.fixture.tsx%22%2C%22name%22%3Anull%7D&fullScreen=true
// ...
```

### Fixture elements (rendered anywhere)

A list of fixture elements to render by hand. A common use case for `getFixtures` is to run snapshot tests in alternative environments like jsdom.

```js
import { getFixtures } from 'react-cosmos';

const fixtures = await getFixtures({ cosmosConfig });

fixtures.forEach(({ fixtureId, getElement }) => {
  const renderer = create(getElement());
  expect(renderer.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot(stringifyFixtureId(fixtureId));
});
```

## Where is my old Cosmos?

Cosmos Classic isn't going anywhere. First, it will take months before a release candidate for v5 (Cosmos Next) is ready. Second, the classic packages have been moved to [a dedicated repo](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos-classic), which means we can continue to maintain Cosmos Classic or even run it alongside Cosmos Next in the same project (during the migration period).

## Troubleshooting
