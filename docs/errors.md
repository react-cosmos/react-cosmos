# Error handling

This is an overview of the error types Cosmos users might have to deal with. All these errors are related to the user's build, which contains only a thin layer of Cosmos communication code. The Cosmos UI (aka _Playground_) is precompiled and runs in a parent frame (or a different environment for React Native users) and, bugs aside, is unlikely to cause errors.

|     | Error type                                                                                            | Support strategy                                                                                 | Other details                                                                           |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Renderer iframe URL not responding (user build is either broken or fails to yield an index.html page) | Show custom error message with popular causes and support link                                   | User has to refresh the page after rebuilding                                           |
| 2   | Hot module replacement with invalid syntax                                                            | Fall back on working build and show compilation error                                            | webpack-hot-middleware prevents applying broken patches and reports the errors          |
| 3   | Module-level runtime error that breaks communication with Cosmos UI                                   | Reveal renderer iframe even if no fixture is selected                                            | react-error-overlay displays error nicely once visible                                  |
| 4   | Render-level runtime error caught by Cosmos' error boundary                                           | Allow regular usage and, for convenience, dismiss error overlay on HMR and upon changing fixture | -                                                                                       |
| 5   | **Static export:** Same as 3 but without react-dev-overlay bundled                                    | Unhandled global exception is only visible in console                                            | Potential improvement: A global exception handler that triggers a dedicated error state |
| 6   | **Static export:** Same as 4 but without react-dev-overlay bundled                                    | Rely solely on componentDidCatch and render rudimentary error state                              | -                                                                                       |
