# Error handling

This is an overview of the error types Cosmos users might have to deal with. All these errors are related to the user's build, which contains only a thin layer of Cosmos communication code. The Cosmos UI (aka _Playground_) is precompiled and runs in a parent frame (or a different environment for React Native users) and, bugs aside, is unlikely to cause errors.

|     | Error type                                                                                            | Support strategy                                                                    | Other details                                                                  |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Renderer iframe URL not responding (user build is either broken or fails to yield an index.html page) | Show custom error message with popular causes and support link                      | User has to refresh the page after rebuilding                                  |
| 2   | Hot module replacement with invalid syntax                                                            | Fall back on working build and show compilation error                               | webpack-hot-middleware prevents applying broken patches and reports the errors |
| 3   | Module-level runtime error that breaks communication with Cosmos UI                                   | Reveal renderer iframe even if no fixture is selected                               | react-error-overlay displays error nicely once visible                         |
| 4   | Render-level runtime error caught by Cosmos' error boundary                                           | Allow regular usage and dismiss error overlay when changing fixture for convenience | -                                                                              |
| 5   | **Static export:** Either 3 or 4, but without react-dev-overlay bundled                               | Rely solely on componentDidCatch and render rudimentary error state                 | -                                                                              |
