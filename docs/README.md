Welcome to the React Cosmos documentation!

## What Is React Cosmos?

React Cosmos is a powerful tool for developing and testing UI components in isolation. It allows you to focus on one component at a time, resulting in faster iteration and higher-quality components.

With React Cosmos, you can build a component library that keeps your project organized and friendly to new contributors. Reusing components across projects saves time and promotes consistency. Sharing your design language with the community enhances collaboration and ensures a cohesive user experience.

React Cosmos revolutionizes component development, testing, and sharing. Its sandbox environment and component library capabilities optimize your workflow, enabling you to deliver exceptional UI experiences.
