# Documentation

> The current docs are for React Cosmos 6. Check out the [migration guide](getting-started/migration.md) to upgrade from v5.

Welcome to the React Cosmos documentation!

## What is React Cosmos?

React Cosmos is a sandbox for developing and testing UI components in isolation.

With React Cosmos, you **develop one component at a time** and at the same time **create a component library**. Both result in tremendous improvements in productivity.

### By developing components in isolation, you:

- Narrow your focus and iterate quickly.
- End up with more reusable components.
- Create test cases that prevent regressions.

### With a component library, you:

- Keep your project organized and friendly to new contributors.
- Reuse components across projects.
- Share your with design language with your community.
