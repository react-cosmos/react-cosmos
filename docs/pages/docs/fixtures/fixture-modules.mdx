# Fixture Modules

A fixture is a React Component or any React Node. A fixture module contains one or more fixtures.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Node Fixtures" href="#node-fixtures" />
  <Card title="Component Fixtures" href="#component-fixtures" />
  <Card title="Multi-Fixtures" href="#multi-fixtures" />
  <Card title="MDX Fixtures" href="#mdx-fixtures" />
</Cards>

## Node Fixtures

<Callout type="info">
  Think of Node fixtures as the return value of a function component, or the
  first argument to `React.render`.
</Callout>

```jsx filename="Button.fixture.jsx"
export default <Button disabled>Click me</Button>;
```

## Component Fixtures

Component fixtures are just React function components with no props. They enable using Hooks inside fixtures, which is powerful for simulating state with stateless components.

```jsx filename="CounterButton.fixture.jsx"
export default () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return <CounterButton count={count} increment={() => setCount(count + 1)} />;
};
```

## Multi-Fixtures

A fixture module can also export multiple fixtures if the default export is an object.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx filename="Button.fixture.jsx"
export default {
  'Primary': <PrimaryButton>Click me</PrimaryButton>,

  'Primary Disabled': <PrimaryButton disabled>Click me</PrimaryButton>,

  'Secondary': <SecondaryButton>Click me</SecondaryButton>,

  'Secondary Disabled': <SecondaryButton disabled>Click me</SecondaryButton>,
};
```

The object property names will show up as fixture names in the Cosmos UI.

> [See this comment](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/issues/924#issuecomment-462082405) for the reasoning behind this solution (vs named exports).

## MDX Fixtures

Creating MDX fixtures is as easy as [configuring MDX for your bundler](https://mdxjs.com/docs/getting-started/#bundler) and using the `.mdx` (or `.md`) file extension for your fixture files.

<Callout type="info">
  Both Vite and Webpack
  [examples](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/tree/main/examples)
  feature MDX fixtures configured with `@mdx-js/rollup` and `@mdx-js/loader`
  respectively.
