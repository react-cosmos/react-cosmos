# Decorators

Wrapping components in fixtures can become repetitive. Decorators can be used to apply context providers (or any other wrapper) to a subset of fixtures.

A `cosmos.decorator` file looks like this:

```jsx filename="cosmos.decorator.js"
export default ({ children }) => <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
```

The rules for decorators are:

- A decorator must be placed in a file named `cosmos.decorator.{jsx,tsx}`.
- A decorator must be a default export.
- A decorator is a React component that receives a `children` prop.
- A decorator only applies to fixture files contained in the decorator's
  directory.
- Decorators can be composed, in the order of their position in the
  file system hierarchy (from outer to inner).

<Callout type="info">
  A `cosmos.decorator` file placed in the root source directory applies to all
  fixtures.
</Callout>

A decorator file can also export an array of decorators:

```jsx filename="cosmos.decorator.js"
export default [Decorator1, Decorator2, Decorator3];
```

## Importing Global CSS

For styles that need to be applied globally—such as `normalize.css`, global variables, or other design system styles—it is recommended **not** to import them inside a decorator. Importing CSS files in a decorator may result in their styles being appended after your fixture styles, which can lead to unexpected styling issues.

Instead, add these CSS files to the `globalImports` array in your [cosmos.config.json](https://reactcosmos.org/docs/configuration/cosmos-config). For example:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["…"],
  "globalImports": [
    "normalize.css",
    "./src/design-system/global-variables.css",
    "./src/design-system/global.css"
  ]
}
```

This ensures that your global CSS is loaded before any fixture-specific styles, maintaining the intended cascade.
