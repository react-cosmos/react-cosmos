# Next.js

This guide covers how to integrate React Cosmos with Next.js 13.4+. It includes support for **React Server Components**. The Cosmos Renderer switches seamlessly between Server and Client components in the same project.

Also check out [react-cosmos/nextjs-example](https://github.com/react-cosmos/nextjs-example), which features both Server and Client fixtures of the glorious [react-tweet](https://github.com/vercel-labs/react-tweet) component.

## Getting Started

Create a [new Next.js project](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) or open an existing one.

Install the required packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i -D react-cosmos react-cosmos-next
```

Create `cosmos.config.json` and point `rendererUrl` to your renderer (we'll get to it in a moment):

```json filename="cosmos.config.json"
{
  "rendererUrl": {
    "dev": "http://localhost:3000/cosmos/<fixture>",
    "export": "/cosmos/<fixture>.html"
  }
}
```

Add `cosmos` and `cosmos-export` scripts to package.json:

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "cosmos": "cosmos --expose-imports",
  "cosmos-export": "cosmos-export --expose-imports"
}
```

Create a basic fixture at `src/Hello.fixture.jsx`:

```jsx filename="src/Hello.fixture.jsx"
export default <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you're using TypeScript replace `.jsx` file extensions with `.tsx`.
</Callout>

Create a Next.js page at `src/app/cosmos/[fixture]/page.tsx`:

```jsx filename="src/app/cosmos/[fixture]/page.tsx"
import { nextCosmosPage, nextCosmosStaticParams } from 'react-cosmos-next';
import * as cosmosImports from '../../../../cosmos.imports';

export const generateStaticParams = nextCosmosStaticParams(cosmosImports);

export default nextCosmosPage(cosmosImports);
```

This is your Cosmos Renderer.

Start Next.js:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Start React Cosmos (in a 2nd terminal):

```bash npm2yarn
npm run cosmos
```

<Callout type="info">
  You'll notice `cosmos.imports.js` was generated. This module is a dependency
  of the Cosmos Renderer. The Cosmos Server updates this file automatically. You
  can add it to .gitignore.
</Callout>

ðŸš€ Open **[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)** in your browser.

That's it. You're now running Server fixtures in React Cosmos!

You can import both Server and Client components in your fixtures, which run on the server by default. You can also add the `'use client'` directive to a fixture module (or decorator) if you want use Hooks inside it.

### Limitations

- Only [Component Fixtures](/docs/fixtures/fixture-modules.md#component-fixtures) fixtures can be exported from a fixture module with the `'use client'` descriptor. That's because Client fixture modules are passed _as is_ to the Server render tree and their exports are expected to be components by design. While [Node Fixtures](/docs/fixtures/fixture-modules.md#node-fixtures) and [Multi-Fixtures](/docs/fixtures/fixture-modules.md#multi-fixtures) cannot be used in Client fixtures, all Cosmos fixture formats are supported in Server fixtures.

## Static Export

The `cosmos-export` command creates a static export of the Cosmos UI shell, which expects a corresponding static Renderer to connect with. Generating the complete export requires stringing a few simple commands together:

```bash
# Build Cosmos
npm run cosmos-export
# Build Next.js
npm run build
# Copy Next.js build into Cosmos export
cp -R ./out/_next ./cosmos-export
cp -R ./out/cosmos ./cosmos-export
```

At this point your static export is ready to be served:

```bash
npx http-server ./cosmos-export
```

## Further Integration

### Separate React Cosmos from Next.js app

One approach for building Cosmos independently in a Next.js app is to organize the Cosmos component library as a separate project within a dedicated `cosmos` subfolder. Cosmos files will have access to the main app through the parent folder and it will only import necessary components.

You can take it a step further and deploy your app and Cosmos separately to two different vercel projects from the same codebase.

Check this repo for more information and an example of this setup: https://github.com/scorado-ltd/scorado-examples-nextjs-cosmos/tree/main

### On making a plugin (Next.js insider help needed)

Running Server Components in Cosmos is awesome but a plugin could take this integration to the next level (no pun intended).

Similar to the Vite and Webpack plugins, a Next.js plugin would:

- Remove the need to wire up the Cosmos Renderer (the `/cosmos` page).
- Hide the user module mappings (the `cosmos.imports` file generated with the `--expose-imports` flag).
- Set the renderer URL automatically with no Cosmos config needed.
- Support static exports out of the box with the `cosmos-export` command.

Making a Cosmos plugin is easy-peasy. Plugging into Next.js is the missing link for a seamless integration.

Ideally we would call the `dev` and `build` Next.js commands programatically. But I don't know if Next.js supports this at the moment. There is a [Custom Server](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server) API but I'm not sure if it works with the App Router architecture and the build part is missing.

In the meantime we can remove the `/cosmos` page from the _out_ dir when deploying our app. Another option is a monorepo with a main Next.js app and a Cosmos Next.js app.
