# Custom Bundler

This is a guide for setting up React Cosmos with any bundler.

<Callout type="info">
  A bit of context: React Cosmos is made out of three main parts: The Server,
  the Renderer and the UI. Setting up a custom bundler integration consists of
  serving the Renderer yourself, without having to do anything special to the
  Server or the UI. But don't worry, Cosmos provides easy-to-use Renderer
  primitives that make it easy to create a custom setup.
</Callout>

Install the required packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i -D react-cosmos react-cosmos-dom
```

Choose a port for the renderer other than the main Cosmos port, say `5050`. Set the renderer URL with the chosen port in your `cosmos.config.json`:

```json filename="cosmos.config.json"
{
  "port": 5000,
  "rendererUrl": "http://localhost:5050"
}
```

Add `cosmos` script to package.json:

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "cosmos": "cosmos --expose-imports"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `--expose-imports` flag will generate a `cosmos.imports.js` module that
  contains maps of user module imports (fixtures and decorators) as well the
  renderer config. Feel free to add this file to .gitignore.
</Callout>

Create a basic fixture at `src/Hello.fixture.jsx`:

```jsx filename="src/Hello.fixture.jsx"
export default <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
```

Finally, create a web server using your bundler of choice that serves an `index.html`, which loads a JS module with the following code:

```js
import { mountDomRenderer } from 'react-cosmos-dom';
import * as mountArgs from './cosmos.imports';

mountDomRenderer(mountArgs);
```

Start React Cosmos:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run cosmos
```

That's it, really.

The Cosmos Server will automatically update `cosmos.imports.js` when fixture/decorator files are added, changed or removed.

To learn how turn your setup into a Cosmos plugin check out the [Vite plugin](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/tree/main/packages/react-cosmos-plugin-vite).
