# Webpack

This is a guide for setting up React Cosmos in a Webpack project.

## Getting Started

Install the required packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i -D react-cosmos react-cosmos-plugin-webpack
```

Create `cosmos.config.json` and enable the Webpack plugin:

```json filename="cosmos.config.json"
{
  "plugins": ["react-cosmos-plugin-webpack"]
}
```

Add `cosmos` and `cosmos-export` scripts to package.json:

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "cosmos": "cosmos",
  "cosmos-export": "cosmos-export",
}
```

Create a basic fixture at `src/Hello.fixture.jsx`:

```jsx filename="src/Hello.fixture.jsx"
export default <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
```

Start React Cosmos:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run cosmos
```

ðŸš€ Open **[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)** in your browser.

The `Hello` fixture will show up in your Cosmos UI and will render when you select it.

**Congratulations ðŸ˜Ž**

You've taken the first step towards designing reusable components. You're ready to prototype, test and interate on components in isolation.

## Webpack Config

Cosmos generates a default Webpack config if a custom one isn't provided.

<Callout type="warning">
  Cosmos compiles your code using dependencies you already installed in your
  project. Cosmos will auto include common loaders like `babal-loader`,
  `ts-loader`, `css-loader`, etc. in the default Webpack config. Use a [custom
  Webpack config](#custom-webpack-config) for more advanced use cases.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure `html-webpack-plugin` is installed in your project.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  You may also need to create a `.babelrc` in your project root.
</Callout>

### Custom Webpack Config

Probably the most common scenario. Most of us end up with a hairy Webpack config sooner or later.

Cosmos picks up `webpack.config.js` from the project root automatically. Use the `webpack.configPath` setting to provide an existing Webpack config at a different path:

```json filename="cosmos.config.json"
{
  "webpack": {
    "configPath": "./tools/webpack.config.js"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  You can also point to a module inside a dependency, like in the [Create React
  App](create-react-app.mdx) example.
</Callout>

### Webpack Config Override

Overriding the Webpack config gives you complete control. Use the `webpack.overridePath` setting to point to a module that customizes the Webpack config used by Cosmos.

```json filename="cosmos.config.json"
{
  "webpack": {
    "overridePath": "./webpack.override.js"
  }
}
```

The override function receives a base Webpack config â€” the default one generated by Cosmos or a custom one loaded from `webpack.configPath`. Extend the input config and return the result.

```js filename="webpack.override.js"
module.exports = (webpackConfig, env) => {
  return { ...webpackConfig /* do your thing */ };
};
```

### Output Filename

Cosmos overwrites `output.filename` in the Webpack config to `[name].js` by default. Due to caching, this isn't ideal when generating static exports via `cosmos-export` command. Use the `webpack.includeHashInOutputFilename` setting to change the filename template to `[name].[contenthash].js`.

```json filename="cosmos.config.json"
{
  "webpack": {
    "includeHashInOutputFilename": true
  }
}
```
