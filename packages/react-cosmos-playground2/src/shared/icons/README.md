This package uses the beautiful [Feather icon set](https://feathericons.com/). All SVGs are placed in this directory for convenience, but only used icons are bundled.

## How to add an icon

Copy-paste the SVG into [index.js](index.js) and create a React component with its elements. See existing icons.

## How to style icons

Icons stretch to 100% width and height, and inherit their stroke color. This gives the parent container direct control over the icon size and color.
