# react-cosmos-config

Reads user cosmos config and extends defaults.

*Notice: While this is a generic package, some of the defaults are webpack-specific options. In the future this can be improved by moving those defaults into client packages and maybe adding an `extraDefaults` param to `getCosmosConfig`.*
