// This config is used in multiple ways:
// 1. Used by code editors. All TS config, aside from build parameters, should
//    be placed here.
// 2. Extended by specific package build configs used to generate TS
//    declarations. Those configs have an "outDir" defined.
// 3. Used by global check-types command (which runs in CI)
