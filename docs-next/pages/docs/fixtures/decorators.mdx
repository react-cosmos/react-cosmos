# Decorators

Wrapping components in fixtures can become repetitive. Decorators can be used to apply context providers (or any other wrapper) to a subset of fixtures.

A `cosmos.decorator` file looks like this:

```jsx filename="cosmos.decorator.js"
export default ({ children }) => <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
```

The rules for decorators are:

- A decorator must be placed in a file named `cosmos.decorator.{jsx,tsx}`.
- A decorator must be a default export.
- A decorator is a React component that receives a `children` prop.
- A decorator only applies to fixture files contained in the decorator's
  directory.
- Decorators can be composed, in the order of their position in the
  file system hierarchy (from outer to inner).
