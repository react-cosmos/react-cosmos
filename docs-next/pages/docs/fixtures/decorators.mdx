# Decorators

Wrapping components in fixtures can become repetitive. Decorators can be used to apply one or more context providers to a group of fixtures automatically.

A `cosmos.decorator` file looks like this:

```jsx filename="cosmos.decorator.js"
export default ({ children }) => <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
```

<Callout type="info">
  A decorator only applies to fixture files contained in the decorator's
  directory. Decorators can be composed, in the order of their position in the
  file system hierarchy (from outer to inner).
