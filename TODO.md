# Roadmap: React Cosmos 2020

## Dedicated RFCs repo

Mixing bugs with feature ideas leads a bad maintainer experience. Bugs and features have a different lifecycle and require a different mindset. Moreover, it's hard to reach "inbox zero" for issues with long-standing feature issues in the mix.

For some, managing bugs is the hard part of being an open source maintainer. Over time, however, I realized that feature ideas have a higher cognitive load. The decisition tree for a bug is clear: Can it be reproduced? Is the requested behavior expected? If both are true, you try to find the source of the problem and come up with a fix. Feature ideas are more fuzzy. You need to assess whether a feature aligns with the project's mission, and even when it does, if it matches the project's priorities enough to pause and meaninfully engage with the proposal.

The dedicated RFCs repo allows feature ideas to be proposed and addressed properly, while keeping the issues list nice and clean. It will allow me and other maintainers to process issues with priority, without neglecting novel ideas from the community, which on the long run are invaluable.

Finally, there's always [Slack](https://join-react-cosmos.now.sh/) for bouncing around ideas without formality.

- [ ] Create react-cosmos/rfcs repo
  - [ ] Research templates and practices from other repos like reactjs/rfcs
- [ ] Move feature idea issues to RFCs repo
- [ ] Update GitHub labels
- [ ] Update GitHub issue templates

## Website enhancements

- [x] Auto deploy on merge
- [x] Redesign header
  - [x] Include version number with link to releases
- [x] Embed Cosmos instance on desktop
  - [x] Add multiple screenshots on mobile
- [ ] SSR?
- [ ] Extract docs from readme to docs.reactcosmos.org
  - [ ] MD-powered, auto-generated from docs/ directory
  - [ ] Sticky side nav

## Parcel support

It's highly probable that a Parcel integration is a low hanging fruit, but some research is required to be sure.

- [ ] Research Parcel integration (preferably as Express middleware attached to Cosmos server)

## Responsive mode improvements

- [ ] Update default devices
- [ ] X/y drag handles to resize viewport

## Input panel improvements

- [ ] Support decimals in number input
- [ ] Range input
- [ ] Select input (dropdown with pre-defined options)

## Expose plugin APIs

There are three types of plugins in React Cosmos. Exposing all three won't be easy, but it's important to make progress before adding more functionality.

- **Fixture plugins**. Fixture _decorators_ are a basic example of fixture plugins. More functionality can be added to decorators by using the FixtureContext. This is already possible, but isn't documented, and the API likely requires improvement before doing so. This type of plugin runs in user land and is thus compiled using the user's build pipeline.
- **UI plugins**. The React Cosmos UI is currently composed from plugins, using an unreleased but independent plugin system. The way UI plugins interact is designed, but the way they are installed isn't. UI plugins have to be installed at runtime. This requires a plugin discovery system and a plugin definition format to be indentified by. Once these requirements are in place a user will be able to install an npm package with one or more React Cosmos plugins, and enable those plugins without having to restart the server or even reload the UI.
- **Server plugins**. Same as UI plugins with regards to installation and the fact that the existing code is already organized around plugins. But the APIs are completely different for server plugins because they mainly revolve around an Express instance and its corresponding HTTP server.

## Multi selected fixtures

There are (at least) two possible solutions:

1. Allow selection of two or more fixtures in the current Cosmos UI (the _Playground_), and show multiple renderer iframes in a grid or a horizontal list in the center area of the layout.
2. A brand new page where all fixtures are rendered one under another, with a search input at the top and possibly other fixture filters.

Experimentation is required to determine the best form. Also something to consider is rendering the same fixture more than once under different screen sizes, similar to [Playroom](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom). This is a "responsive" feature, but it also involves handling multiple renderer iframes on the same page so it's good to keep in mind while working on multi fixture functionality.

## Interesting but not a priority (for now)

These are good ideas that come up often but are more distant to the core React Cosmos mission than the functionality mentioned above. It's still good to explore these ideas for when the time is right, but it's also important to understand that these ideas will be treated with little priority and most likely are content for a future roadmap.

- **Component docs**. Showing some component documentation when opening a fixture is indeed useful, and a number of solutions have already been implemented by the community using fixture decorators. A better solution, however, would be to show the docs in a pane outside the renderer iframe. This is a great candidate for a UI plugins, which is why no official solution will be released before an official UI plugin API.
- **MDX fixtures**. Can be different fixture format (.mdx fixture files), or a separate type of page that can reference fixtures inside. This is a promising idea, but it's unclear where it fits in the UI developer's workflow. _Is it strictly a documentation feature? Should it be a type of fixture or something on top of fixtures?_

# Roadmap: Cosmos 5

> **Dec 29, 2019:** It took time, but React Cosmos 5 is released, together with a shinny new website ðŸŽ‰. With 2020 right around the corner, it's time to take a step back, reflect, and lay down a plan for the future.

# Roadmap: Cosmos Next

> **May 6, 2019:** JSX fixtures have been well received and already adopted by some, even though they're released under an early alpha version. The new UI has slowly evolved and will soon outgrow Cosmos Classic. Lots of exciting ideas in the pipeline for the new Cosmos platform, some including the latest addition to React: Hooks. Old packages have been moved to [a dedicated repo](http://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos-classic) and the Cosmos repo is now 100% fresh TypeScript code. Cosmos Next is here to stay, time to focus on a public release!

The innovations included in the next generation of Cosmos have already been designed, tested and implemented for the most part. This roadmap will put the the all-new **JSX fixtures** and **Pluggable UI** into the user's hands.

The aim for _Cosmos Next_ is to provide ~80% parity with Cosmos 4.x along with brand new features. The upgrade will be **opt-in** and there will be a exhaustive beta phase before a transition plan is devised for the stable channel.

## Step 1: Port UI to plugin architecture

> Note: The development of JSX fixtures is coupled to the new Pluggable UI. JSX fixtures use a new communication protocol that only the new UI understands and vice-versa. So they both need to be released at the same time. This was a risky engineering endeavor, but it allowed leapfrogging intermediate development steps.

We need a decent parity with the existing Cosmos UI to test JSX fixtures. This is the main requirement for releasing Cosmos Next for beta testing.

- [x] Establish testing practices for new UI package
- [x] Create router for new UI
- [x] MVP feature set for new UI
  - [x] Full screen mode
    - [x] Remove renderer full screen mode (renderer URL belongs to user)
  - [x] Remote renderer (WebSockets)
    - [x] Enable remote renderer(s) on web
    - [x] Sync fixture state between renderers (this wasn't required at this step but is _so_ cool)
  - [x] Collapsable fixture tree view
    - [x] Persist state
  - [x] Responsive mode
  - [x] Style
    - [x] Fixture blank state
    - [x] Fixture error state
  - [x] JSX decorators
  - [x] Renderer error handling
    - [x] Renderer preview URL error
    - [x] react-error-overlay integration
      - [x] Always show preview iframe after error occurred
      - [x] Dismiss overlay when changing fixture

**Not** included in the first beta release: The Fixture Editor. This is because it'll be replaced by something _much_ more powerful (a new Control Panel). But this section will have arrive later, after the core of Cosmos Next has been thoroughly tested.

## Step 2: Get feedback on JSX fixtures

- [x] "How to use" document for beta testers
- [x] Release 4.7
  - [x] Blog post

## Next Steps

- [ ] Basic Control Panel (props/state visualization and editing)
- [ ] More Control Panel features
  - [ ] General purpose UI controls mapped to render props
  - [ ] Option to reset or transition props (it currently does former)
  - [ ] Capture state from Hooks
- [x] Multiple fixtures per file
  - [x] Named exports
  - [x] Dynamically generated n-fixtures
- [ ] UI-generated fixture variations
- [ ] Refine and document UI plugin API
  - [ ] Avoid superfluous React updates on plugin state change
- [ ] Redesign Cosmos docs
