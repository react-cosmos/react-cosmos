> **New: [Cosmos 3.0, the version you’ll fall in love with](https://medium.com/@skidding/cosmos-3-0-the-version-youll-fall-in-love-with-28a862ecf72e)**

Cosmos scans your project for components and enables you to:

1. Render components under any combination of props, context and state
2. Mock *every* external dependency (eg. API responses, localStorage, etc)
3. See app state evolve in real-time while interacting with running instances

![Component Playground](intro.gif)

> Working with Cosmos improves component design because it surfaces dependencies. Cosmos forces us to define sane component inputs, making our UIs predictable and easier to debug down the road.

Read the story of React Cosmos: [Fighting for Component Independence](https://medium.com/@skidding/fighting-for-component-independence-2a762ee53272)

## Why Cosmos?

Many other component explorers emerged in the past years. [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) and [React Styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) are good examples, but you can find an extensive list of options [here](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/cookbook.html#are-there-any-other-projects-like-this). To decide which tool is best for you check for each project's goals, how much they match your needs, and how well the project is maintained.

**Cosmos is a dev tool first, made to improve *all* components, big and small, not just the stateless UI bits.** The [fixture](#fixtures) and [proxy](#proxies) architecture doubles as an [automated testing utility](#experimental-test-helpers), providing a complete solution for developing robust and reusable components. Cosmos also makes it easy to create a living style guide, but it's a secondary goal and you might get more value from alternatives if this is your chief concern.

To find out more about the Cosmos project, check out [Mission](CONTRIBUTING.md#mission), [Goals](CONTRIBUTING.md#goals) and [Architecture](CONTRIBUTING.md#architecture).

## Usage

Requirements:

- [x] React >=0.14.9
- [x] webpack or Browserify (or roll your own integration)
- [ ] [Fixtures](#fixtures) (you'll create them after getting started)

React Cosmos works best with webpack. Making it work with other bundlers takes extra work, but a complete [Browserify example](examples/browserify) is available.

### Getting started

Install via npm

```bash
npm install --save-dev react-cosmos
```

or Yarn

```bash
yarn add --dev react-cosmos
```

Add package.json scripts

```diff
"scripts": {
+  "cosmos": "cosmos"
+  "cosmos:export": "cosmos-export"
}
```

Run `npm run cosmos` or `yarn cosmos` and go to [localhost:8989](http://localhost:8989) 🎉

> If you rely on the default webpack config, make sure to install the Babel and webpack plugins yourself. Depending on your needs, you'll probably want `babel-preset-env babel-preset-react babel-loader style-loader css-loader html-webpack-plugin`. Finally, add `.babelrc` to your project root.
> ```
> {
>   "presets": ["env", "react"]
> }
> ```

#### Next steps

If everything's working
- **Create your first [fixture](#fixtures)**
- Configure or create [proxies](#proxies) (e.g. Redux integration)

If something's wrong
- Extend existing [webpack config](#custom-webpack-config)
- See [popular integrations](#integration-with-popular-tools) (e.g. CRA or Next.js)
- Extend your [config](#config)
- Be kind and [report what went wrong](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/issues)

### Fixtures

> **Old fixtures need to be adjusted to work with Cosmos v3**. Check out this [guide for upgrading](docs/fixture-upgrade.md).

#### What's a fixture?

A fixture is a JS object used to mock component input and external dependencies. The input can be [props](#props), [children](#children), [state](#state) and [context](#context). With the help of [proxies](#proxies), fixtures can mock anything else a component depends on, from API responses to localStorage.

```js
import Input from './Input';

export default {
  component: Input,
  props: {
    value: 'Lorem ipsum',
    disabled: true,
    onChange: value => console.log(`Select: ${value}`)
  }
}
```

> Check out this [quick hack](docs/fixtures.md) for getting started with fixtures.

#### Where to put fixtures?

Cosmos looks for `*.fixture` named files and files inside `__fixtures__` dirs by default. See [custom fixture paths](#custom-fixture-paths) for further customization.

#### Props

Mocking props is the most basic thing a fixture can do.

```js
export default {
  component: Auth,
  props: {
    loggedIn: true,
    user: {
      name: 'Dan the Man'
    }
  }
}
```

#### Children

Composition is the name of the game and many React components expect [children](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#children-in-jsx). Components access them via `props.children`, but children are not quite *props* so we put them under `fixture.children`.

```jsx
export default {
  component: Text,
  children: (
    <div>
      <p>Fixture ain't afraid of JSX</p>
      <p>Fixture ain't afraid of nothin!</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### State

Mocking state is where things get interesting. [Component state](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#state) is private IRL, but Cosmos allows us to inject it and simulate all the various states a component can find itself in.

```js
export default {
  component: SearchBox,
  state: {
    searchQuery: 'Who let the dogs out?'
  }
}
```

### Proxies

#### What's a proxy?

Proxies are Cosmos plugins, allowing fixtures to go beyond mocking *props* and *state*.

We've seen `component = f(props, state)` a hundred times–the seductive promise of React and libs alike. **In reality, however, it's more like `component = f(props, state, context)` and most components are *nothing* without the context part.** This is still an oversimplification. The ugly truth is components take input from many other places: API responses, localStorage and window size to name a few.

But we know developing components in isolation is *The Way*, so intricate inputs won't stop us! With proxies, we look the devil in the eye and mock anything components depend on. Hell, we might even simplify our components once we're aware of all the crazy things they need to work.

How do proxies work? Well duh, they're *Just Components*. As regular React components, proxies compose in the order they are listed in your config and decorate the loaded component, respecting the contract to render the next proxy in the chain. They can be stateless or have a life cycle, mocking before mounting and unmocking before unmounting.

Proxies have two parts:

1. **Configuration.** Done once per project, inside [cosmos.proxies.js](#where-to-put-proxies). Import proxy packages, call their default export (always a *create* function) and add the result to the list of exported proxies. Some proxies require options, others work out of the box.
2. **Activation**. Triggered by a special fixture attribute. Eg. The React Router proxy activates when `fixture.url` is defined, otherwise it's a noop. Proxies can also be always-active, but it's a best practice to make proxies opt-in to avoid useless overhead.

#### Where to put proxies?

As soon as you're ready to add proxies to your Cosmos setup, create `cosmos.proxies.js` (in your project's root directory or next to cosmos.config.js) and export a list of proxies in the order they should load–from outermost to innermost.

> `proxies.cosmos.js` requires compilation so you may need to place it next to your source files (eg. if the `src` dir is whitelisted in babel-loader). Use `proxiesPath` option to customize its location.

Here's an example where we mock the Fetch API and add Redux and React Router providers:

```js
// cosmos.proxies.js
import createFetchProxy from 'react-cosmos-fetch-proxy';
import createReduxProxy from 'react-cosmos-redux-proxy';
import createRouterProxy from 'react-cosmos-router-proxy';
// We can import app files here
import configureStore from './configureStore';

// Read more about configuring Redux in the Redux proxy section below
const ReduxProxy = createReduxProxy({
  createStore: state => configureStore(state)
});

// We ensure a specific proxy order
export default [
  // Not all proxies have options, and often relying on defaults is good enough
  createFetchProxy(),
  ReduxProxy,
  createRouterProxy()
];
```

> For details on *creating* proxies, see the [Proxy boilerplate](CONTRIBUTING.md#proxy-boilerplate)

Jump to:
- [Context](#context)
- [Redux](#redux)
- [React Router](#react-router)
- [React Apollo (GraphQL)](#react-apollo-graphql)
- [Fetch](#fetch)
- [XHR](#xhr)
- [LocalStorage](#localstorage)
- [More proxies...](#more-proxies)

#### Context

[React Context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html): *With great power comes great responsibility.*

> Note: React doesn't recommend using *context* unless you're a lib, so in most cases we're better of using a higher level proxy like the [Redux](#redux) or [React Router](#react-router) one.

##### Configuration

```js
// cosmos.proxies.js
import createContextProxy from 'react-cosmos-context-proxy';

const ContextProxy = createContextProxy({
  childContextTypes: {
    theme: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  },
});

export default [
  ContextProxy,
  // ...other proxies
];
```

##### Activation

```js
// __fixtures__/example.js
export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  context: {
    theme: {
      backgroundColor: '#f1f1f1',
      color: '#222'
    }
  }
}
```

Check out the [context example](examples/context) to see the proxy in action.

#### Redux

Most components in a [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) app depend on Redux state, either they're a *container* or one of their descendants is. This proxy creates a store using initial data from fixtures and puts it in the context, just like the [Provider](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html#passing-the-store) does.

##### Configuration

```js
// cosmos.proxies.js
import createReduxProxy from 'react-cosmos-redux-proxy';
import configureStore from './configureStore';

const ReduxProxy = createReduxProxy({
  createStore: state => configureStore(state)
});

export default [
  ReduxProxy,
  // ...other proxies
];
```

##### Activation

```js
// __fixtures__/example.js
export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  // An empty object will populate the store with the initial state
  // returned by reducers. But we can also put any state we want here.
  reduxState: {}
}
```

Writing Redux fixtures almost feels too easy. Because Redux state is global, once we have one state mock we can render any component we want!

#### React Router

> Warning: react-cosmos-router-proxy is designed for React Router **v4** and above

[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is used in most React projects. Wrapping components with `withRouter` makes the Router context an implicit dependency–one we need to mock.

##### Configuration

```js
// cosmos.proxies.js
import createRouterProxy from 'react-cosmos-router-proxy';

export default [
  createRouterProxy(),
  // ...other proxies
]
```

##### Activation

Simply adding a `url` to your fixture will wrap the loaded component inside a [Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/api/Router).

```js
// __fixtures__/example.js
export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  url: '/about'
}
```

Optionally, `route` can be added to also wrap the loaded component inside a [Route](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/api/Route).

```js
// __fixtures__/example.js
export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  url: '/users/5',
  route: '/users/:userId'
}
```

Check out the [React Router example](examples/react-router) to see the proxy in action.

#### React Apollo (GraphQL)

If you use the [React integration](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/) of [Apollo Client](http://dev.apollodata.com/) to provide data in your app, you may want to provide mocks for isolated UI testing with GraphQL.
Your components wrapped with the `graphql` higher-order component provided by `react-apollo` depends on the `ApolloProvider` defined at the top-level of your app. This proxy does that for you!

##### Configuration

Provide:
- GraphQL type definitions
- A [Mock object like you would with `graphql-tools`](http://dev.apollodata.com/tools/graphql-tools/mocking.html)

```js
// cosmos.proxies.js
import createApolloProxy from 'react-cosmos-apollo-proxy';

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    hello(who: String): String
  }
`;

const mocks = {
  Query: () => ({
    hello: (root, { who }) => `Hello ${who ? who : 'C O S M O S'}`,
  }),
};

export default [
  createApolloProxy({
    typeDefs,
    mocks,
  }),
  // ...other proxies
];
```

##### Activation

It's activated out of the box!

Check out the [Apollo example](examples/apollo) to see `react-cosmos-apollo-proxy` in action.

#### Fetch

Besides client-side state, components also depend on external data. Mocking server responses allows us to completely isolate our components. This proxy makes mocking [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) responses a breeze.

##### Configuration

```js
// cosmos.proxies.js
import createFetchProxy from 'react-cosmos-fetch-proxy';

export default [
  createFetchProxy(),
  // ...other proxies
]
```

##### Activation

```js
// __fixtures__/example.js
export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  fetch: [
    {
      matcher: '/users',
      response: [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: 'Prabu',
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          name: 'Karla',
        },
        {
          id: 3,
          name: 'Linbaba'
        }
      ],
    },
  ]
};
```

Built on top of [fetch-mock](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/api). Check out the [Fetch example](examples/fetch) to see the proxy in action.

#### XHR

> **Warning: Currently the XHR proxy breaks hot reloading.** Subscribe to [#430](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/issues/430) for updates.

Like the [Fetch](#fetch) proxy, but for *XMLHttpRequest*.

##### Configuration

```js
// cosmos.proxies.js
import createXhrProxy from 'react-cosmos-xhr-proxy';

export default [
  createXhrProxy(),
  // ...other proxies
]
```

##### Activation

```js
// __fixtures__/example.js
export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  xhr: [
    {
      url: '/users',
      response: (req, res) =>
        res.status(200).body([
          {
            id: 1,
            name: 'Blossom',
          },
          {
            id: 2,
            name: 'Bubbles',
          },
          {
            id: 3,
            name: 'Buttercup'
          }
        ]),
    },
  ],
};
```

Built on top of [xhr-proxy](https://github.com/jameslnewell/xhr-mock). Check out the [Axios example](examples/axios) to see the proxy in action.

#### LocalStorage

Overrides the global localStorage API with a replica mock.

Mocking localStorage prevents conflicts with existing browser data and enables the localStorage API in test environments like Jest.

##### Configuration

```js
// cosmos.proxies.js
import createLocalStorageProxy from 'react-cosmos-localstorage-proxy';

export default [
  createLocalStorageProxy(),
  // ...other proxies
]
```

##### Activation

```js
// __fixtures__/example.js
export default {
  component: MyComponent,
  localStorage: {
    userToken: 'foobar-token'
  }
};
```

#### More proxies

Other proxies created by the Cosmos community:
- [alp82/react-cosmos-glamorous-proxy](https://github.com/alp82/react-cosmos-glamorous-proxy) A simple proxy for react-cosmos to load glamorous themes

*What proxy would you create to improve DX?*

### Integration with popular tools

#### Create React App

Add `react-cosmos` to dev dependencies and create `cosmos.config.js`.

```js
// cosmos.config.js
module.exports = {
  containerQuerySelector: '#root',
  webpackConfigPath: 'react-scripts/config/webpack.config.dev',
  publicPath: 'public',
  // Optional: Add this when you start using proxies
  proxiesPath: 'src/cosmos.proxies'
};
```

Also make sure to:
- Put [proxies](#proxies) in the `src` dir–the only place included by the CRA Babel loader

*CRA + Cosmos example: [Flatris](https://github.com/skidding/flatris)*

#### Next.js

Add `react-cosmos` to dev dependencies and create `cosmos.config.js`.

> Next.js apps run on both client & server, so compilation is done via Babel plugins instead of webpack loaders. This means we can rely on Cosmos' default webpack config.

```js
// cosmos.config.js
module.exports = {
  publicPath: 'static',
  publicUrl: '/static/',
};
```

Also make sure to:
- Add `html-webpack-plugin` to your dev dependencies
- Define `.babelrc` for the Cosmos webpack config to rely on the Next.js preset:

```json
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
}
```

*Next.js + Cosmos example: [Illustrated Algorithms](https://github.com/skidding/illustrated-algorithms)*

#### React Boilerplate

Add `react-cosmos` to dev dependencies and create `cosmos.config.js`.

```js
// cosmos.config.js
module.exports = {
  containerQuerySelector: '#app',
  webpackConfigPath: './internals/webpack/webpack.dev.babel',
  globalImports: ['./app/global-styles.js'],
};
```

#### React Redux Starter Kit

Add `react-cosmos` to dev dependencies and create `cosmos.config.js`.

```js
// cosmos.config.js
module.exports = {
  webpackConfigPath: 'build/webpack.config.js'
}
```

Also make sure to:
- Set up the [Redux proxy](#react-cosmos-context-proxy) :)

### Config

The Cosmos config is optional, but it's very likely you'll want to create one at some point to set some custom options. The standard approach is to put a `cosmos.config.js` file in your project root.

#### Custom config path

Use the `--config` CLI arg if you prefer not placing the config in the project root.

```js
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "cosmos": "cosmos --config path/to/cosmos.config.js"
}
```

Set the `rootPath` option to match the project root when using a custom config path. All other paths defined in the config are relative to rootPath.

```js
// cosmos.config.js
module.exports = {
  rootPath: '../../'
};
```

#### Custom webpack config

The default webpack config included in Cosmos checks to see which packages you have installed and, if found, automatically includes the Babel, CSS and JSON loaders, as well as the HtmlWebpackPlugin.

If you already have a hairy webpack config that you'd like to reuse, set the `webpackConfigPath` option to your webpack config's file path and Cosmos will do its best to extend it.

#### Custom fixture paths

The `fileMatch` and `exclude` options are used to detect fixture files. The default fileMatch value is meant to accommodate most needs out of the box:

```
'**/__fixture?(s)__/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
'**/?(*.)fixture?(s).{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'
```

> Note: Set the `rootPath` to a dir parent to all fixture files when using a [custom config path](#custom-config-path)

TODO: Add `fixtureDir` and `fixtureSuffix` options for easier file match customization [#488](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/issues/488)

#### Option dump

Options supported by `cosmos.config.js`.

```js
// cosmos.config.js
module.exports = {
  // Set all other paths relative this this one. Important when cosmos.config
  // isn't placed in the project root
  rootPath: '../',

  // Additional entry points that should be present along with any component.
  // Sad, but inevitable.
  globalImports: [
    './reset.css',
    './global.css',
  ],

  // Customize pattern(s) for matching fixture files
  fileMatch: [
    '**/fixtures-in-here/**/*.js'
  ],

  // Fixtures will not be loaded in the playground if their names match these
  exclude: [
    /not-a-fixture/,
    /its-complicated/,
    /its-not-me-its-you/,
  ],

  // Where to serve static files from. Like --content-base in webpack-dev-server.
  publicPath: 'src/public',

  // Set base URL for static assets from public folder
  publicUrl: '/static/',

  // Customize proxies file path. Useful if Babel doesn't compile the root dir.
  proxiesPath: 'src/proxies.cosmos',

  // Render inside custom root element. Useful if that root element already
  // has styles attached, but bad for encapsulation.
  containerQuerySelector: '#app',

  // Disable hot module replacement
  hot: false,

  // HTTP proxy specific requests to a different target
  httpProxy:  {
    context: '/api',
    target: 'http://localhost:4000/api',
  },

  // These ones are self explanatory
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 8989,
  webpackConfigPath: './config/webpack.config.dev',
};
```

### Exporting

Static Component Playground? Piece of 🍰! Add this script and run `npm run cosmos:export` or `yarn cosmos:export`.

```diff
"scripts": {
+  "cosmos:export": "cosmos-export"
}
```

### Experimental: Test helpers

> **Stay tuned:** New API for testing fixtures with Enzyme coming soon!

Fixtures can be reused inside automated tests. Along with proxies, they replace elaborate test preparation and render a component with a single JSX tag.

```js
import { mount } from 'enzyme';
import { Loader } from 'react-cosmos-loader';
import fixture from './hello.fixture';

it('should render hello message', () => {
  const wrapper = mount(<Loader fixture={fixture} />);
  expect(wrapper.text()).toMatch(/Hi there/);
});
```

#### Global Jest snapshot

You can create a snapshot of all your components with `react-cosmos-telescope`. A single snapshot file for all components isn't ideal, but it makes a difference until you have time to create granular tests.

```js
import runTests from 'react-cosmos-telescope';

runTests({
  cosmosConfigPath: require.resolve('./cosmos.config.js'),
});
```
