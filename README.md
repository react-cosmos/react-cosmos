Sandbox for developing and testing UI components in isolation.

- **Visual TDD.** Develop one component at a time. Isolate the UI you&apos;re
  working on and iterate quickly. Reloading your whole app on
  every change is slowing you down!
- **Component library.** Bookmark component states, from blank states to edge
  cases. Your component library keeps you organized and provides a solid
  foundation of test cases.
- **Open platform.** React Cosmos can be used in powerful ways. Including
  snapshot and visual regression testing, as well as custom integrations
  tailored to your needs.
