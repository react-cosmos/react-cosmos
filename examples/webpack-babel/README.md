> Run `yarn` and `yarn build` in the root directory first. Then you can run `yarn start` inside this example directory.

This example is tied to the Cosmos [monorepo](../CONTRIBUTING.md#monorepo), which makes it useful for internal development, but not as useful as a starter kit because some dependencies are implicit.

Here are some external examples that didn't sit comfortably in this monorepo:

> **Warning**: The external examples might use [Cosmos Classic](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos-classic), a previous version that is no longer referenced in the monorepo.

- [Cosmos with Create React App](https://github.com/react-cosmos/create-react-app-example)
- [Cosmos with Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-cosmos/create-react-native-app-example)

And here are some real life examples:

- [Flatris](https://github.com/skidding/flatris) (Redux, Jest snapshots)
- [Illustrated Algorithms](https://github.com/skidding/illustrated-algorithms) (Custom proxies, Jest snapshots)
