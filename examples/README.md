> Run `yarn` and `yarn build` in the root directory first. Then you can run `yarn start` inside any example directory.
>
> You may also need to run commands like `yarn start:server` (e.g. in the Apollo example app). Be sure to check the scripts found in each example's `package.json`.

These examples are tied to the Cosmos [monorepo](../CONTRIBUTING.md#monorepo). This makes them useful for internal development, but not for using them as a starter kit.

Here are some external examples that didn't sit comfortably in this monorepo:

- [Cosmos with webpack v1](https://github.com/react-cosmos/webpack1-example)
- [Cosmos with Create React App](https://github.com/react-cosmos/create-react-app-example)
- [Cosmos with Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-cosmos/create-react-native-app-example)

And here are some real life examples:

- [Flatris](https://github.com/skidding/flatris) (Redux, Jest snapshots)
- [Illustrated Algorithms](https://github.com/skidding/illustrated-algorithms) (custom proxies, Jest snapshots)
