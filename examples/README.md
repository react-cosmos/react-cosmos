> Run `yarn` and `yarn build` in the root directory first. Then you can run `yarn start` inside any example directory.
>
> _You may also need to run commands like `yarn start:server` (e.g. in the Apollo example app). Be sure to check the `scripts` found in each example's `package.json`._

These examples are tied to the Cosmos [monorepo](../CONTRIBUTING.md#monorepo). This makes them useful for internal development, but not for using them as a starter kit. You might also want to check these standalone examples:
