These examples are tied to the Cosmos source. This makes them useful for internal development, but not for using them as a starter kit. You might also want to check these standalone examples:

- [Flatris](https://github.com/skidding/flatris) (Redux, Jest snapshots)
- [Illustrated Algorithms](https://github.com/skidding/illustrated-algorithms) (custom proxies, Jest snapshots)
