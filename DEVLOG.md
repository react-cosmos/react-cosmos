Q: Does `fixtureStateSync` renderer response provide any value?

Not anymore, since the `setFixtureState` renderer request now contains the full fixture state, which has already been computed by the Playground before dispatching it to the renderers (akin to an optimistic update). A confirmation sounds nice in theory, but it's problematic in two ways:

- More than one `setFixtureState` request can be dispatched before a `fixtureStateSync` response returns. Since we don't have an linked message architecture in place (and it's unlikely we'll ever need one as this is a local dev tool and the volume of messages is low), we can't really tell if the "sync" response is valid and what request it refers to.
- We're not using the confirmation in any way at the moment.

Removing it.

Q: Should the `setFixtureState` renderer request contain partial or full fixture state? Or both in separate message types?

There's a clear need for a request message that sends the entire fixture state: When sending a new fixture state received from one renderer to the other connected renderers, to keep them in sync. This can't happen with a message that sends partial fixture state for the renderer to merge, because removing a part of the fixture state will not work.

So is there still value in requesting partial fixture state changes? Payload size isn't an issue in a dev tool. What about concurrency? Even though fixture state change requests are sent in full, before a new fixture state is dispatched from Playground to renderers, fixture state changes are applied using updater functions of type `prevState => nextState`, which ensures that all state changes from Playground plugins are honored, regardless of timing.

Given that no drawback is obvious at this time, and for simplicity, I'll go with a single `setFixtureState` renderer request that contain the fixture state in full.

Q: How to send selected fixture (from URL params) to renderers on Playground load?

Should _Router_ know about (and listen to) the `fixtureList` renderer response? Because we can't select a fixture until the renderer responds with the user's fixture list. Or should _RendererMessageHandler_ know about the `urlParams` state?

Maybe a third, more elegant option will surface later. But for now the latter, because _RendererMessageHandler_ already listens to `fixtureList` responses.

Q: How can the Playground sync fixture state between multiple renderers?

...and prevent infinite loops.

There's currently a single `fixtureState` renderer response dispatched both on organic state changes as well as on state changes caused by `setFixtureState` requests.

Initial (flawed) solution: The `fixtureState` response is also used to sync fixture states between renderers as follows. When a `fixtureState` response arrives from a renderer, a `setFixtureState` request (with the received state) is dispatched to all other renderers. But each of these requests then generate corresponding `fixtureState` responses which in turn creates an infinite loop.

Working solution: Split `fixtureState` renderer response in two separate messages:

1. A `fixtureStateSync` message in response to a `setFixtureState` request. It's meant to confirm the request and let the requester know the resulting state. Doesn't involve other renderers.
2. A `fixtureStateChange` message in response to an organic state change inside a renderer. The remote client (the Playground) can broadcast the state change to all other renderers to keep them in sync.

---

Q: Can the fixture state be deterministic between renderers?

The current limitation is that FixtureCapture instances get assigned auto-incremented unique IDs (ie. `FixtureDecoratorId`). The rest of `fixtureState` is already deterministic.

Solution: Manually set ID to FixtureCapture elements instead of deriving it from the run-time instance. This requires an extra prop when using FixtureCapture by hand (eg. to capture props/state of elements inside render functions). But this is an edge case. The main usage of FixtureCapture is implicit: FixtureProvider wraps the entire fixture with an FixtureCapture element and it can give it a "root" ID that the user never sees.

Q: What's the different between a method and an event in the plugin API?

- Calling a method that hasn't been registered fails. Emitting an event that nobody's listening to doesn't.
- A method can return a value. An event listener can't.
- Only one handler can be registered for a method name. Multiple listeners can be added for an event name.

Q: What's the vision for the plugin UI and the shortcomings in the current implementation?

The vision is for the plugin API to go beyond React. Not because I want to use other renderers, but because not all plugin parts are related to rendering. Here are the main plugin parts:

1. Shared state
2. Public methods
3. Plugin event listeners
4. Other event listeners (eg. on window scroll)
5. Render output

Each plugin handler has access to a _plugin context_. With the plugin context we can read and write shared state, call public methods of other plugins and emit events. All this is possible outside React's context. So _a lot_ of what goes on in a UI plugin doesn't result in visual output (eg. DOM nodes).

The existing UI plugins have already been designed around this architecture, but the current plugin API is not quite _there_ yet. Until I have time to design the _ultimate UI plugin API_, all plugins parts are forced into the React lifecycle. This allowed me to focus on shipping Cosmos and not get completely sidetracked by the plugin API (as exciting as it is).

Notes to remember when iterating on the plugin API:

- Add support for `slotProps` â€” props that are passed to a UI _slot_ at run time by the slot's parent component

Q: Why does Lerna what to publish new versions for packages that haven't changed?

Eg. `lerna changed` returns `react-cosmos-shared`. But `lerna diff react-cosmos-shared` returns null.

So, although the source hadn't changed, [this piece of code](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/ac0baa7b1d5c378f794c960ab13d70242d19ddc8/utils/collect-updates/collect-updates.js#L56-L57) determines that a package _needsBump_. The decision process seems convoluted, but my deduction is that once a package has a pre-release version, it will keep getting bumped until the monorepo enters a regular release cycle.

---

Q: Should fixture state-related tests run against a single fixture or a fixture list (ie. FixtureContainer or FixtureConnect)?

The fixture state's purpose is to serve the remote coordination between the Playground and the renderer. So the tests should run against the API that communicates with remote clients such as the Playground. Actually, `fixtureState` itself shouldn't be the test subject, but the remote messages sent and received.

Moreover, at the moment the fixture state is just a private detail of FixtureContainer (the API used to render fixtures in unit tests).

---

Q: Why does the fixture state duplicate when hot reloading `ComponentState`?

First off, the fixture doesn't unselect (like below) because ComponentState isn't imported by FixtureConnect or any of its imports. So the previous fixture state is kept. And when the new ComponentState type mounts, it will have a new instance ID and create a new fixture state entry, oblivious of the existing state entry initiated by the old ComponentState type.

---

Q: Why does the fixture unselect when hot reloading `CaptureProps`?

Because FixtureConnect (which imports FixtureProvider, which imports CaptureProps) gets hot-reloaded and remounts.

---

Q: Why do components wrapped in `ComponentState` re-render when props of an unrelated component change in the fixture state?

A: Because `ComponentState` also wraps its children in `CaptureProps`, which re-renders whenever any _fixtureState.props_ instance changes.

Fix: ~~Implement deep equality check for fixtureState props/state instance transitions.~~ [Done](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/commit/44bb9cec91dbb8dc4a788fdca50d897d841171e9) and [done](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/commit/126fda74a1e97bbce061443c7ab08f1b8fdc023c).

Q: Why does the user webpack build require _babel-polyfill_ on IE 11, but the Playground webpack build doesn't?

Which package relies on (unpolyfilled) Promises?

Answer: `async-until` (addressed in https://github.com/skidding/async-until/pull/3)

Not sure why I was setting `polyfill: false` to `transform-runtime` plugin in every Babel config. I think it only makes sense if you're certain a global polyfill (like _babel-polyfill_) is always imported before the compiled code. Not a good idea for libraries!

Fixed in: https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos/pull/820

Q: How to link fixture state to specific component instances?

Context: A fixture can render more than one component element, which means it can hold state for more than one component instance (of the same type or of different types) at the same time. We need an identifier for each component instance.

Options:

- A. Component type
- B. Component instance (ref)
- C. Component element
- D. Decorator instance (ref)

A. doesn't work because we can have multiple child instances of the same type in one fixture.

B. doesn't work because stateless components don't have instances.

C. doesn't work because AFAIK elements have neither unique reference nor content

D. works well. But different types of fixture state (eg. props and component state) **can't be grouped per component instance**. Each type of fixture state will be identified by the instance of its corresponding decorator. We can't reliably group decorator instances by child type because, as mentioned above, more children of the same type can coexist in a fixture.
