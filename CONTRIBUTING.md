## Hey there!

So you want to know more about React Cosmos... _Sweet!_

> You're probably a nice person and don't need to hear this. At the same time, however, you _could_ be one of the assholes roaming the world. So please follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and respect the people you interact with.

## Goals

**Make UI developers more productive.**

This is _the_ goal. The means are built on the following insight: Designing components in isolation yields reusable components. Reusability is at the heart of productivity.

**Help UI developers think long term.**

UI development is all fun and games at first. But sooner or later it gets messy. _Massively messy._ Why? Because calling them "components" isn't enough to avoid tight coupling. Developing components in isolation discourages coupling.

**Make UI development fun.**

As UI developers, we spend our days improving other people's digital experience. _What about us?_ Let's treat ourselves with the same delightful experience we've accustomed our users to. Something something virtuous circle.

## How to contribute

It's common to only think of open source contributions as code. But if you're new to a project submitting a PR should almost never be the first thing you do. Even the most organized codebases have a learning curve. Learn how a project works before trying to change it.

Here's a list of things you can do to help React Cosmos, sorted by project exprience required:

1. _Use_ the project. Understand its capabilities.
2. Provide user feedback.
3. Propose ideas to improve onboarding and user experience â€“ not just features :).
4. Respond to issues you know how to solve.
5. Engage with the community.
6. Engage in roadmap & design discussions.
7. Fix known bugs.
8. Implement agreed upon changes.

### Be kind and thoughtful

We're all short on time, so be realistic and don't expect special treatment. The better we communicate the more likely we'll end up collaborating.

### Ask for review

ðŸ‘‰ **[Use the RFCs process for substantial changes](https://github.com/react-cosmos/rfcs)**

**Please propose an idea before coding it.** Otherwise your work might get rejected, which is never fun. Save everybody's time by asking for feedback _before_ implementing something.

### CI failed on your PR?

Open the CI build page. See what went wrong and learn to run the checks locally. Don't expect a review if your build is broken. Ask for help if you can't figure it out.

> Working on Cosmos requires Node 8 or newer

[Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) and [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) make it possible to publish independent packages and still test the project end-to-end.

Tools are installed globally in the root node_modules. This includes Jest, TypeScript, Webpack, and their corresponding plugins. ESLint is also applied globally. Creating a new package has less overhead because of this. React and Webpack deps are also installed once in the root node_modules to avoid version conflicts or bundling multiple copies of React.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:react-cosmos/react-cosmos.git
cd react-cosmos

# Install deps and link packages
yarn

# Basic commands
yarn check-types
yarn test
yarn build

# Run example and test React Cosmos end to end
yarn start

# Cosmos #inception
yarn start:playground

# Build single package in watch mode
yarn build react-cosmos-playground2 --watch

# Test watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Single test watch mode
yarn test:watch path/to/my/testfile
```

### Test your work

In most cases write automated tests. TDD where applicable, but don't force it. Write concise, maintainable tests. Tests should be as readable as source code.

Look inside `__tests__` folders and files ending with `.test` for test examples.

### Stay consistent

Add [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) to your editor if possible.

When naming files:

- Use _camel case_ for files: `fixtureState.js`. Capitalize components: `DragHandle.js`.
- Use _kebab case_ for package names: `react-cosmos-playground2`.

When creating a module:

- **Named exports** are preferred over default exports.
- **Function declarations** are preferred over arrow functions at the module level (because the order doesn't matter when using the former).
